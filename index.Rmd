```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an a scatter plot made from the cars dataset.

```{r cars, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
